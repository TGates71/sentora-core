## Description

[Sentora](https://sentora.org) is based on an original fork of ZPanelCP. Sentora is a complete open-source web hosting control panel written in PHP and is designed to work with Linux, UNIX and the BSDs.

Sentora is developed and maintained by original ZPanel team members (TGates, Me.B and Jettaman).

Sentora is designed to be installed on a minimal OS with NO webserver packages pre-installed.
